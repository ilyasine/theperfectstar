== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Help! My theme doesn't look right! =

Okay, deep breath. More than likely, it is another plugin causing this issue. See if you can pinpoint which one by disabling your plugins, one by one, and really determining if you need it. If that task sounds daunting, try disabling plugins that are used for photo galleries, minifying scripts, widgets, or otherwise alter your blog's appearance.

= Can I change the look of my Vimeography theme? =

Heck yeah! Use the appearance editor to change your theme's style so that it matches your site perfectly.
